# Sites Directory

This directory will contain individual site folders for each generated Top10 product niche site.

## Structure

Each site will be organized as:
```
sites/
├── best-coffee-makers/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── data.json
├── best-wireless-headphones/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── data.json
└── ...
```

Sites are currently generated as Jekyll posts in the `_posts` directory with data in `_data`.
This folder is reserved for future enhancements where each site gets its own independent folder.
